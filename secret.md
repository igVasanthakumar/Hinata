Certainly! Below are the steps to pull the Ubuntu image from Docker Hub, launch a web application in a container on port 8080, and make it reachable globally:

1. **Pull Ubuntu Image from Docker Hub:**

   ```bash
   docker pull ubuntu
   ```

2. **Create a Dockerfile:**
   Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM ubuntu

   # Install necessary dependencies
   RUN apt-get update && \
       apt-get install -y curl

   # Expose port 8080
   EXPOSE 8080

   # Command to run your web application (replace this with your actual command)
   CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]
   ```

3. **Build Docker Image:**
   Navigate to the directory containing your `Dockerfile` and build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-web-app .
   ```

4. **Run Docker Container:**
   Run the Docker container, mapping port 8080 to the host machine:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 my-web-app
   ```

   Replace `"my-web-app"` with your desired container name.

5. **Make the Application Reachable Globally:**
   - If you are running this on a local machine, ensure that your firewall allows traffic on port 8080.
   - If you are running this on a cloud platform, configure security groups or firewall rules to allow incoming traffic on port 8080.

Now, your web application should be accessible globally via `http://your-host-ip:8080`. Make sure to replace `"your-host-ip"` with the actual IP address of your host machine or the public IP provided by your cloud platform.

Keep in mind that this example uses a basic `echo` command as the web application. Replace the `CMD` in the Dockerfile with the command to start your specific web application.

Certainly! Here are the steps to deploy an Nginx application on your Kubernetes cluster and make it available across the cluster on port 80:

1. **Create Deployment YAML:**
   Create a file named `nginx-deployment.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: nginx-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: nginx
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: nginx
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: nginx
             image: nginx:latest
             ports:
               - containerPort: 80
   ```

2. **Apply the Deployment:**
   Apply the deployment to your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Expose the Deployment:**
   Create a service to expose the Nginx deployment within the cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl expose deployment nginx-deployment --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=ClusterIP
   ```

4. **Make the Service Accessible Across the Cluster:**
   If you want to make the Nginx service accessible across the entire cluster, you can expose it using a `NodePort` or `LoadBalancer` service type. For example, using `NodePort`:

   ```bash
   kubectl expose service nginx-deployment --port=80 --target-port=80 --type=NodePort
   ```

   This will allocate a random port on each node, and you can access Nginx using any node's IP and the allocated port.

5. **Access Nginx:**
   If you used `NodePort`, you can find the allocated port using:

   ```bash
   kubectl get service nginx-deployment
   ```

   Use any node's IP and the allocated port to access Nginx globally within the cluster.

That's it! Now, your Nginx application should be deployed on your Kubernetes cluster and accessible across the cluster on port 80. Adjust the service type based on your requirements (ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer).

Certainly! Below are the steps to deploy a web application in a Kubernetes pod, create a replica set, and scale the replica set when the load increases:

1. **Create Deployment YAML:**
   Create a file named `web-app-deployment.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: web-app-deployment
   spec:
     replicas: 3
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: web-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: web-app
       spec:
         containers:
           - name: web-app-container
             image: your-web-app-image:latest
             ports:
               - containerPort: 80
   ```

   Replace `"your-web-app-image"` with the actual image name of your web application.

2. **Apply the Deployment:**
   Apply the deployment to your Kubernetes cluster:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f web-app-deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Create Replica Set:**
   Since Deployments manage ReplicaSets under the hood, you don't need to create a separate ReplicaSet. The Deployment will create and manage it for you.

4. **Scale the Replica Set:**
   If the load on your web application increases, you can scale the number of replicas in the deployment. For example, to scale to 5 replicas:

   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment web-app-deployment --replicas=5
   ```

   Adjust the number of replicas based on your actual requirements.

5. **Monitor the Scaling:**
   You can monitor the scaling and the status of your deployment using:

   ```bash
   kubectl get deployment web-app-deployment
   ```

   This command will show you the current number of replicas and the desired number of replicas.

By following these steps, you've deployed a web application in a Kubernetes pod, created a replica set using a Deployment, and demonstrated how to scale the number of replicas in response to increased load. Adjust the replica count as needed based on your application's requirements and resource availability.

Certainly! Below is an example Ansible playbook that installs the `httpd` package, starts and enables the `httpd` service, and copies an `fstab` file to the `/tmp` folder on the remote server.

Create a file named `web-server-setup.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
---
- name: Configure Web Server
  hosts: your_target_servers
  become: true # Run tasks with elevated privileges (sudo)

  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd package
      yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable httpd service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: yes

    - name: Copy fstab file to /tmp
      copy:
        src: /path/to/local/fstab/file
        dest: /tmp/fstab
```

Replace:

- `your_target_servers` with the actual group or host where you want to apply this playbook.
- `/path/to/local/fstab/file` with the path to your local `fstab` file.

Save the playbook and execute it using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i your_inventory_file web-server-setup.yaml
```

Make sure to replace `your_inventory_file` with the path to your Ansible inventory file.

This playbook uses Ansible tasks to perform the specified actions on the target servers. Adjust the playbook according to your environment and requirements.

Certainly! Below is an example of how you can achieve the steps you mentioned using Docker, Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service). This example assumes you have the AWS CLI configured with the necessary credentials.

### 1. Create a Sample Java Web App:

Create a simple Java web app using Maven. For example, you can create a file named `DockerWebApp.java`:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
@SpringBootApplication
public class DockerWebApp {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DockerWebApp.class, args);
    }

    @RequestMapping("/")
    public String home() {
        return "Hello, Docker World!";
    }
}
```

### 2. Create a Dockerfile:

Create a `Dockerfile` in the same directory as your Java code:

```Dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
COPY target/docker-web-app.jar /app.jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "/app.jar"]
```

### 3. Build the Docker Image:

Build the Docker image using the following commands:

```bash
mvn clean package
docker build -t your-docker-image-name .
```

Replace `your-docker-image-name` with your desired image name.

### 4. Tag and Push the Image to ECR:

Assuming you have set up an ECR repository, tag and push the Docker image:

```bash
# Tag the image
docker tag your-docker-image-name:latest <your_ecr_registry_url>/your-docker-image-name:latest

# Login to ECR (replace <your_region>)
aws ecr get-login-password --region <your_region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <your_ecr_registry_url>

# Push the image to ECR
docker push <your_ecr_registry_url>/your-docker-image-name:latest
```

### 5. Create an ECS Task Definition:

Define an ECS Task Definition that uses the Docker image from ECR. Create a file named `ecs-task-definition.json`:

```json
{
  "family": "your-task-family",
  "containerDefinitions": [
    {
      "name": "your-container-name",
      "image": "<your_ecr_registry_url>/your-docker-image-name:latest",
      "cpu": 256,
      "memory": 512,
      "essential": true,
      "portMappings": [
        {
          "containerPort": 8080,
          "hostPort": 8080
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace:

- `your-task-family` with your desired ECS Task Definition family name.
- `your-container-name` with your desired container name.

### 6. Register the ECS Task Definition:

Register the ECS Task Definition using the following command:

```bash
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://ecs-task-definition.json
```

### 7. Create an ECS Service:

Create an ECS Service that uses the registered Task Definition:

```bash
aws ecs create-service --cluster your-ecs-cluster-name --service-name your-service-name --task-definition your-task-family --desired-count 1
```

Replace:

- `your-ecs-cluster-name` with your ECS cluster name.
- `your-service-name` with your desired ECS service name.

Now, your Java web app should be deployed on ECS using the Docker image stored in ECR. Adjust the names and configurations based on your specific requirements.

Certainly! Below is an example Terraform configuration to create an EC2 instance in the `us-east-1` (North Virginia) region, with a security group named "web access" allowing inbound traffic on ports 22 and 80.

Create a file named `main.tf` with the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Specify your desired AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web_access" {
  name        = "web access"
  description = "Allow inbound traffic on ports 22 and 80"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example_instance" {
  ami             = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Specify your desired AMI ID
  instance_type   = "t2.micro"
  security_group  = [aws_security_group.web_access.id]

  tags = {
    Name = "example-instance"
  }
}
```

This configuration does the following:

1. Specifies the AWS provider with the `us-east-1` region.
2. Creates an EC2 instance with a specified AMI, instance type, and tags.
3. Defines a security group named "web access" allowing inbound traffic on ports 22 and 80.
4. Associates the "web access" security group with the EC2 instance.

Make sure to replace the AMI ID (`ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0`) with the AMI ID you want to use.

Run the following commands in the same directory as your `main.tf` file:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform will prompt you to confirm the creation of resources. Type "yes" to proceed. After the execution is complete, Terraform will provide information about the created resources, including the public IP address of the EC2 instance.
